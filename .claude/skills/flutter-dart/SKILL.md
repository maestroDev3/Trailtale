# Flutter/Dart – conventions for Trailtale

Sources: the official Flutter AI `rules.md`, Effective Dart, the Flutter App
Architecture Guide, VGV skills. Only what applies to this project or deliberately
deviates is written here. On conflict: user > CLAUDE.md > this skill.

## 1. Architecture (layers)

| Folder | Content | May import |
|---|---|---|
| `lib/domain` | Models, pure logic, repository **interfaces** | only `dart:` and `lib/domain` – **no** `package:flutter` |
| `lib/data` | Repository implementations, platform services (storage, notifications) | `lib/domain`, packages |
| `lib/ui` | Screens and widgets | `lib/domain`, `package:flutter`, generated l10n – **never** `lib/data` directly |
| `lib/l10n` | ARB files (`app_en.arb` is the template) | – |
| `lib/main.dart` | Wiring: create instances, pass them via constructors | everything |

- Repositories are the single source of data; they return `Future`/`Stream` and don't know about each other.
- Platform APIs (plugins) only behind an interface in `lib/domain` (e.g. `NotificationScheduler`), implementation in `lib/data`.
- Time always comes via `Clock` (`typedef Clock = DateTime Function()`) or a `today`/`now` parameter. No `DateTime.now()` in `lib/domain` or widgets except as default argument `clock = DateTime.now`.
- Days are normalized with `dayOf()` (UTC midnight) so daylight saving time never shifts days.

## 2. State

- No state management package (no provider/riverpod/bloc/get_it), no code generation except Flutter's built-in `gen-l10n` (no freezed/build_runner), navigation with `Navigator` (no go_router).
- Showing data: `StreamBuilder` over repository streams. Local UI state: `StatefulWidget` or `ValueNotifier`.
- If logic in a widget grows beyond a few lines, it moves to `lib/domain` as a pure function/class (testable without widgets).
- After every `await` in a `State`, check `mounted` before `setState`/`context`.

## 3. Dart style

- Names: types `UpperCamelCase`, files `lower_snake_case.dart`, everything else `lowerCamelCase` (constants too). No abbreviations.
- **Everything in English**: identifiers, comments, UI texts. Doc comments `///` start with a sentence stating the *why*/purpose.
- Domain models are immutable: `final` fields, `const` constructor where possible, changes via `copyWith`/methods returning a new instance.
- Variants as `sealed class` + exhaustive `switch`. Multiple return values as records.
- No `!` on nullable values – use patterns (`case final x?`) or early `return`.
- No positional `bool` parameters; use named parameters.
- Invalid input in the domain: `ArgumentError`; state errors: `StateError`. Never swallow silently.
- Imports: `dart:` → `package:` → relative; inside `lib/` relative imports, in tests `package:trailtale/...`.
- Formatting is decided by `dart format`; `flutter analyze` (flutter_lints) must report nothing.

## 4. Widgets, design and localization

- Sub-UIs as small private widget classes (`_WeekRow`), no methods returning widgets (exception: short `switch` expressions).
- `const` wherever possible; nothing expensive in `build()`; lists via `ListView.builder`/`SliverList.builder`.
- Colors and text styles only from `Theme.of(context)` (`colorScheme`, `textTheme`) – no hex values in widgets. Theme in `lib/ui/theme.dart`, light and dark.
- Material 3; consistent patterns: cards (`Card`), `SliverAppBar.large`, bottom sheets with `showDragHandle`, `FilledButton`/`OutlinedButton`. Recurring building blocks as widgets in `lib/ui/widgets/`.
- **No hard-coded UI strings.** Every visible text comes from `AppLocalizations` (ARB key in `app_en.arb` with `@description`). Plurals and placeholders via ICU syntax. Dates, numbers and currency formatted with `intl` using the current locale.
- Icon buttons get a `tooltip` (also serves as semantics label).
- Texts must be allowed to wrap with large system fonts (no fixed `height` for text containers).

## 5. Tests (TDD is mandatory, see CLAUDE.md)

- Structure mirrors `lib/`: `test/domain`, `test/data`, `test/ui`. Test helpers in `test/support/` (no `_test.dart` suffix).
- Fakes instead of mocks (no mockito/mocktail): `Fake<Name>Repository`, `FakeNotificationScheduler`. New interfaces get a fake in `test/support/`.
- Fixed times: tests define `today`/`now` as constants and pass them in; never depend on the real clock.
- Layout: one `group` per class/function or behavior, `test` descriptions as English sentences (“keeps the streak with a joker”). Arrange – Act – Assert.
- Widget tests: `pumpApp` from `test/support/pump_app.dart` (sets theme, localization delegates with `en` locale and phone size); find widgets by visible text or `Key`, not by widget hierarchy.
- Every acceptance criterion of the issue has at least one test. Platform code that can only be checked on a device gets a “test manually” note in the PR.

## 6. Dependencies and Android

- Standard base packages without further justification: `shared_preferences` or `sqflite` (storage), `path_provider`, `flutter_local_notifications` + `timezone` + `flutter_timezone`, `flutter_localizations` + `intl`.
- Other packages only with justification in the PR; check the version first (`git ls-remote --tags` of the package repo, pub.dev is blocked in Claude's environment).
- Mark Android changes (manifest, Gradle, plugins with native code) in the commit message with `[apk]` so CI builds the APK on the branch.
- No permission without a purpose; justify every new permission in the PR. No `INTERNET` unless a decision requires it.

## 7. Definition of done (per task)

- [ ] Test commit red in CI, then green
- [ ] `flutter analyze` clean, `dart format` compliant
- [ ] Domain free of Flutter imports, time via Clock/parameter
- [ ] Stored data backward compatible (old data still loads – migration test)
- [ ] UI texts in ARB files (English), theme colors, tooltips on icon buttons
- [ ] PR with `Closes #nr`, what/why/tests

## 8. Common mistakes

| Don't | Do |
|---|---|
| `DateTime.now()` in logic | `clock()` / `today` parameter |
| Logic in `build()` or `onPressed` | pure function in `lib/domain` |
| `setState` after `await` without `mounted` | `if (!mounted) return;` |
| Widget imports `lib/data/...` | interface from `lib/domain` via constructor |
| `Text('Save')` | `Text(AppLocalizations.of(context).save)` |
| `print` for debugging | write a test; errors as exceptions |
| New storage format without migration | version the keys, read the old one, test it |
| `Color(0xFF…)` in a widget | `Theme.of(context).colorScheme…` |

## 9. Project-specific: Trailtale

- `GeoPoint` validates ranges (latitude −90…90, longitude −180…180 → otherwise `ArgumentError`); distances via haversine in the domain, with tests.
- Time zones: entries store the instant in UTC **and** the local UTC offset; grouping into trip days uses local time (test: an entry at 23:30 local time stays on the same day).
- Photos are copied into the app directory (not just referenced); only the relative path is stored. EXIF reading sits behind an interface (`PhotoMetadataReader`) with a fake in tests.
- The map lives behind its own wrapper widget so the provider stays swappable; widget tests replace the map with a placeholder.
- Location only “while in use”, never in the background.
